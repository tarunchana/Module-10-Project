Figure 1: The increase in the price level since the pandemic in the UK is the highest across the G7,,,,,,,
"Consumer Price Index, 2018 to 2023",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Notes,"1. UK figures are based on CPI inflation. Figures for other countries are based on the national measures of consumer price indices as reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Unlike the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices – which is not produced by all G7 countries – there are methodological and conceptual differences between national measures.
2. Imputed rentals for housing, also referred to as owner-occupied housing (OOH) costs, are included in CPI inflation in Canada, Germany, Japan, and the US. In contrast, it is not included in the UK, France and Italy CPI inflation. 
3. Including imputed rentals into French, Italian, and UK CPI inflation would be expected to lower their headline inflation rate, as these OOH costs are typically less volatile than food and energy prices. Indeed, the UK CPIH which includes OOH recorded a smaller cumulative increase than UK CPI.",,,,,,
