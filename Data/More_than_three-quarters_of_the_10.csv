Figure 3: More than three-quarters of the 10.4% increase in CPI in February 2023 can be explained by the direct effects of energy prices and where the indirect effects are largest,,,,,,
"Contributions to Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation by energy intensity, percentage points, UK, January 2019 to February 2023",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Notes,"1.  These energy intensity groups are based on broadly equal sets of CPI classes, by weight, so the “very low” category is the 25% of classes with the lowest energy intensity, the “low” category is those between the 25th and 50th percentile and so on.
2.  We use the latest available CPI weights, which are for 2023. We keep the categories the same throughout the reference period. Expenditure weights are updated annually so there may be some slight variation in the classes included in each category if they were to be adjusted annually.
3.  Direct energy components have been separately captured to show their direct effect. Rents are also shown separately as they have a low energy intensity but have been making increasing contributions to CPI, driven by other factors specific to the housing market. We would not expect energy prices to be a large factor in determining rental prices.",,,,,
